## Quickstart

The desktop app depends on Docker already being installed and running on your system.

https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/ArchiveBox/desktop && cd desktop

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app
npm start
```

Note: If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.
